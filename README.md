# The Quantum Trail: An Educational Quantum Game for Students

Daniel Wang, Venkata Menta, Abhinav M. Hari, Ramya Iyer

## Introduction
Quantum computing is a new, rising field of study and many students our age are unaware of the possibilities it can create. We wanted to provide an opportunity for future quantum learners to learn about the history of quantum computing and physically implement simple quantum circuits through IBM Quantum Machines.

The game uses four gates: 
 - Pauli-X: This gate is the quantum equivalent of a classical NOT gate. 
 - Pauli-Y:
 - Pauli-Z: This gate is the quantum equivalent of a classical FANOUT gate.
 - Hadamard: This gate places the qubit in a superposition state. 

In this game, students are given an option to choose your adventure game combining an individual's entertainment to the concepts of a genius.

## Future Additions
During the hackathon, our team came up with many great ideas and implements to our current game that were shelved due to the lack of time. Here is a list of the developments we would like to implement in the near future to expand the user interface. 

 - Create a visual component to the challenges (similar to an escape room)

## Experience
Our team had an amazing experience at iQuHACK for the second time. In fact, last year, we met through this contest and have stayed in touch through our common interests. We hope to continue to implement our future changes to the game and make it more interactive for the users.

## Inspirations
Our game was inspired by [The Oregon Trail](https://www.visitoregon.com/the-oregon-trail-game-online/) for the quantum history section and [Qiskit Blocks](https://github.com/JavaFXpert/QiskitBlocks) for the challenges.
