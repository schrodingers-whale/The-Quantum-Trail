# The Quantum Trail: An Educational Quantum Game for Students

## Introduction
Quantum computing is a new, rising field of study and many students our age are unaware of the possibilities it can create. We wanted to provide an opportunity for future quantum learners to learn about the history of quantum computing and physically implement simple quantum circuits through IBM Quantum Machines.

The game uses four gates:

 - Pauli-X: This gate is the quantum equivalent of a classical NOT gate.
 - Pauli-Y: This gate is a pi radian rotation around the y-axis on the block sphere.
 - Pauli-Z: This gate is the quantum equivalent of a classical FANOUT gate.
 - Hadamard: This gate places the qubit in a superposition state.

In this game, students are given an option to choose your adventure game combining an individual's entertainment to the concepts of a genius.

## Goals

The goal of our project is to design an interactive learning environment for students who are interested in learning the basic history of quantum computing. Through the user input, students will go down a trail of various scientists who created the fundamental elements of quantum computing and complete challenges to advance.

## Mechanics of The Quantum Trail

Similar to choosing your own adventure games, the user will go back in time to discover quantum computingâ€™s history. They will be able to talk to various scientists like De Brogile, Schrodigner, Heisunburg, Einstein, and Feynman. They learn about the history of quantum computing and the contribution of each scientist to the understanding of quantum computing. The player learns the wavelength equation from De Broglie, while Schrodinger teaches the player about superposition and the hadamard gate. Einstein then walks the player through superposition and the CNOT gate, finally Feynman teaches the other Pauli gates, with this exploration the user will have the knowledge to build simple circuits.

In the challenges, users will be able to test their quantum knowledge through interactively creating a string of alphabets that are shorthand for different quantum gates. These quantum gates will be sent to an IBM machine.

## Future Additions

During the hackathon, our team came up with many great ideas and implements to our current game that were shelved due to the lack of time. Here is a list of the developments we would like to implement in the near future to expand the user interface.

 - Create a visual component to the challenges (similar to an escape room)
 - Add underlying quantum circuits in the quantum history section
 - Create live animations for scientists and user figures.
 - Expand the number of pathways in the adventure trail
 - Making the game a functional webpage/app to publish
 - Making the story line more broad and having more sequence of dialogues. 

## Experience

Our team had an amazing experience at iQuHACK for the second time. In fact, last year, we met through this contest and have stayed in touch through our common interests. We hope to continue to implement our future changes to the game and make it more interactive for the users.

## Inspirations

Our game was inspired by [The Oregon Trail](https://www.visitoregon.com/the-oregon-trail-game-online/) for the quantum history section and [Qiskit Blocks](https://github.com/JavaFXpert/QiskitBlocks) for the challenges.
